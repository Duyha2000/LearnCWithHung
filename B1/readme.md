# Programming Exercises

## Exercise 1:

a. Check if an integer n is even or odd:
Write a program to check if an integer n entered from the keyboard is even or odd. If it is even, print "Even number".
If it is odd, print "Odd number".

-> Example:

Input: n = 10
Output: "Even number"
[main.c](../main.c)
Input: n = 151
Output: "Odd number"
Use either a regular if/else statement or the ternary operator condition ? true : false.

b. Compare two salaries:
Write a code snippet that accepts the salaries of two people and finds out who has the higher salary.

Output: If the first person has the higher salary, print "person1". If the second person has the higher salary, print "
person2".

## Exercise 2:

Accept a character input and determine if it is an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter, or a non-letter character.

Output:

For uppercase letters, print "upper-case alphabet".
For lowercase letters, print "lower-case alphabet".
For non-letter characters, print "not an alphabet".

## Exercise 3:

Grade Classification: Input an integer score (0â€“100) and classify it as follows:

<= 50: "Weak"
> 50 and <= 60: "Average"
> 60 and <= 75: "Good"
> 75 and <= 90: "Very Good"
> 90: "Excellent"
> Example: For score = 65, the output is "Good".

## Exercise 4:

Determine if a given year is a leap year.

Output: Print "Year year is a leap year!" or "Year year is not a leap year!" based on the rules:

Divisible by 4 but not by 100, or divisible by 400.
Example:

Input: 2000
Output: "Year 2000 is a leap year!"

Input: 1999
Output: "Year 1999 is not a leap year!"

## Exercise 5:

Mapping:Given a number from 0 to 6, write a program to print the corresponding day of the week.

0 -> Sunday, 1 -> Monday, 2 -> Tuesday, 3 -> Wednesday, 4 -> Thursday, 5 -> Friday, 6 -> Saturday.
Example:

Input: 0
Output: "Day of the week: Sunday"

Input: 4
Output: "Day of the week: Thursday"

## Exercise 6:

Evaluate an arithmetic expression based on two integers a, b, and a character operator c (+, -, *, /).

Example:

Input: a = 7, c = '+', b = 9
Output: 16

## Exercise 7:

Swapping two integers a and b: Write a program to swap the values of a and b.

Example:

Input: a = 3, b = 4
Output after swap: a = 4, b = 3

## Exercise 8:

Convert seconds into hours, minutes, and seconds: Input an integer s representing seconds and convert it into hours,
minutes, and seconds.

Example:

Input: s = 3905
Output: 1h5m5s
