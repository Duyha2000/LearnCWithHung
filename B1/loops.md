# Programming Exercises

## Exercise 1: Write a program that takes an integer input n and displays all even numbers from n up to 100.

Example: If n = 90, the program should display: 90 92 94 96 98 100.

## Exercise 2:

Input a number and calculate its factorial.
Example: 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.

## Exercise 3:

Write a program that takes two integers, a and b, from the keyboard. Then, display all numbers between a and b that are
divisible by both 3 and 5.
Example: If a = 1 and b = 50, the program should display: 15 30 45.

## Exercise 4:

Input an integer, calculate the sum of its digits, and print its reverse.
Example: 8243
-> Sum = 3 + 2 + 4 + 8
-> Reverse: 3428.
hint: while, /10, %10

## Exercise 5:

Develop a multifunctional program that allows the user to select a function from a menu.
The menu includes:

1. Check if a number is even or odd.
2. Check if a number is prime.
3. Check if a number is divisible by 3.
4. Exit.
   Hints for implementation:

+ Declare a variable choice to store the user's selection.
+ Use a while loop to display the menu and let the user enter their choice.
+ Use a switch statement to direct the program to the selected function. If the input is invalid, display an error
  message and ask the user to try again.

## Exercise 6:

Develop a program to calculate the perimeter and area of different shapes based on a menu of options. The menu includes:

1. Calculate the perimeter and area of a rectangle.
2. Calculate the perimeter and area of a triangle.
3. Calculate the perimeter and area of a circle.
4. Exit.
   Hints for implementation:

+ Declare a variable choice to store the user's selection.
+ Use a while loop to display the menu and let the user enter their choice.
+ Use a switch statement to direct the program to the selected function. If the input is invalid, display an error
  message and ask the user to try again.

## Exercise 7:

Input an integer n and display the number of divisors of n.
Example: If n = 12, the program should display 6 (because 12 has divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12).

## Exercise 8:

Input two positive integers, a and b. Then, display the result of a^b.
Example: If a = 2 and b = 3, the program should display: 8 (because 2 * 2 * 2 = 8).

## Exercise 9:

In ra số nhỏ nhất > 0 chia hết cho 3,5,7
Output: 105
